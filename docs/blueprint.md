## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust and reliability, suitable for a problem-solving tool. It avoids negative associations that could arise from colors like red.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) provides a clean and neutral backdrop, reducing visual strain.
- Accent color: Use a muted teal (#4DB6AC) for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for all body and headline text, because it's readable and neutral.
- Design the application specifically for PC screens.
- Divide the interface into logical sections, with clear labeling for complaints and their associated details.
- Utilize recognizable icons for complaint categories.
